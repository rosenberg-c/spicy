# Agent Guidelines

Before starting implementation work:

- Read `docs/` and any root-level project notes if they exist.
- Read `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` and relevant files under `docs/requirements/` for behavior changes.
- If documentation conflicts, follow the most specific file for that area.
- Apply project-specific rules from `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`.

Rule ownership:

- `AGENT.md` = how to work (communication, decision-making, change process)
- `docs/RULES.md` = generic engineering defaults
- `docs/RULES_TYPESCRIPT.md` = TypeScript/React-specific defaults
- `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` = spicy-specific policy and technical constraints

A question is not a change request.

## Communication

### Clarify when it matters

Ask for clarification when:

* requirements are materially ambiguous
* the decision is hard to reverse
* multiple approaches have meaningful tradeoffs
* user preference significantly impacts the outcome

Do not block on clarification when:

* a reasonable default exists
* ambiguity is minor
* the decision is low-risk and reversible

When proceeding under uncertainty:

* state assumptions clearly
* choose conservative, easy-to-change defaults

---

### Questions are not change requests

When the user asks a question:

* answer the question directly
* do not assume code or file changes are required
* suggest changes only when they add clear value

---

### Prefer progress over unnecessary back-and-forth

Do not ask questions to avoid making decisions.

If sufficient context exists:

* proceed
* state assumptions
* briefly explain tradeoffs

---

## Decision-making

### Prefer reversible decisions

Make simple, reversible decisions by default.

Escalate when a decision would:

* lock in architecture
* affect external contracts
* introduce migration cost
* constrain future changes

---

### Default to the simplest design that fits

Prefer:

* minimal layers
* explicit code
* standard library solutions
* existing project conventions

Avoid introducing abstraction before it is needed.

---

### State tradeoffs clearly

When recommending an approach:

* explain why it fits
* identify tradeoffs
* note when an alternative would be better

---

## Explanations

### Use structure when it improves clarity

Prefer structured explanations when describing:

* flows
* dependencies
* ownership
* system boundaries

Use:

* short bullet lists
* ASCII diagrams when helpful

Example:

```txt
Client -> Handler -> Service -> Repository -> Store
```

```txt
Task
 ├─ ID
 ├─ Title
 ├─ Completed
 └─ UpdatedAt
```

Avoid diagrams that are harder to read than prose.

---

### Prefer concrete examples

Use:

* small code snippets
* before/after comparisons

Avoid presenting multiple equivalent options without a clear recommendation.

---

## Code and architecture

### Follow existing conventions first

* align with the current codebase style
* prefer established project patterns
* avoid mixing competing approaches without reason

---

### Prefer standard patterns over custom solutions

* use official documentation
* follow library-native patterns
* prefer idiomatic language usage

Do not reinvent existing abstractions.

---

### Keep boundaries explicit

Separate:

* transport (API)
* domain logic
* persistence
* UI

Avoid leaking framework or generated types across layers.

## Changes and safety

### Make the smallest effective change

* modify only what is required
* preserve existing behavior unless change is intentional
* avoid unrelated refactors

---

### Do not commit changes

* stage files when needed for review
* do not create commits
* let the user author/finalize commits

---

### Highlight risky changes

Call out changes affecting:

* public APIs
* storage formats
* concurrency
* migrations
* generated code
* authentication or security

Project-specific risk handling and constraints live in `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`.

---

### Do not edit generated code

* update the source definition or generator config
* regenerate instead of editing output
* extend via wrappers or adapters if needed

---

## Testing and validation

### Match validation to scope

* small change -> targeted test
* contract change -> broader coverage
* tooling/build change -> run relevant pipelines

---

### Prefer focused verification

* start with the smallest useful check
* expand only if needed

---

## Writing style

### Be direct and specific

Prefer:

* clear recommendations
* concise reasoning
* explicit tradeoffs

Avoid:

* vague guidance
* unnecessary verbosity
* excessive hedging

---

### State assumptions explicitly

When context is incomplete:

* state assumptions clearly
* do not imply certainty where it does not exist

---

## Short version

Clarify only when it matters
Prefer simple, reversible decisions
Follow existing conventions and official docs
Make the smallest effective change
Keep boundaries explicit
State assumptions and tradeoffs clearly
